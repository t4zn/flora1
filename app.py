Most prefer temperatures 65-80°F with low humidity (30-50%). Overwatering causes root rot - their #1 killer."

Water at soil level to prevent black spot (Diplocarpon rosae). Apply balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) monthly during growing season. Prune in late winter to promote air circulation and remove diseased canes."

Check soil moisture 1-2 inches deep. Water thoroughly until drainage occurs - shallow watering encourages surface roots. Morning watering reduces fungal diseases by allowing leaves to dry."

CAM plants (succulents) are highly light-efficient. Measure: Full sun (6+ hours direct), partial (3-6 hours), shade (<3 hours). Indoor plants need 1000-3000 foot-candles depending on species."

Good potting mix contains 40% organic matter (peat/compost), 30% drainage material (perlite/vermiculite), 30% structure (bark/coir). pH affects nutrient availability - most plants prefer 6.0-7.0.

Air layering for difficult species. Seeds require proper temperature and moisture. Rooting hormones (auxins) accelerate root development. Success rates vary by species and season."

Summer stress requires adequate water and heat protection. Fall signals dormancy preparation - reduce fertilizing. Winter dormancy conserves energy - minimal water, no fertilizer. Some plants require cold stratification for flowering."
